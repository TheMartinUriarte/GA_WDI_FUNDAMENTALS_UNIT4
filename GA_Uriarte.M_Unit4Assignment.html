		<h1>Memory Game</h1>

		<h2>Instructions</h2>
			<p>Concentration, also known as Match Match, Memory, Pelmanism, Shinkei-suijaku, Pexeso or simply Pairs, is a card game in which all of the cards are laid face down on a surface and two cards are flipped face up over each turn. The object of the game is to turn over pairs of matching cards.</p>

		<h2>Where's the thrill?</h2>
			<p>You know that moment when you're full after going to town on a bunch of chow mein and you're thinking you'll never eat again? Well remember how that all flew out the window when you got your fortune cookie because you're dying to know what your fortune and lucky numbers are for that lotto ticket you won't buy? That rush of excitement you get with fortune cookies is what you'll feel when you play Concentration and start turning cards over in hopes of making a pair. Best part? You're in control of your destiny by using your memory to ensure that when you flip the right card, you're a winner, and I think we all know there's no better thrill than that.</p>

		<h2>How can I thank you!?</h2>
			<p>No thank is necessary, sainthood has been bestowed upon me already for the creation of this game, but if you are still insisting you can find me <a href="www.linkedin.com/themartinuriarte">here</a>!</p>
